## About <a name="about"></a>

Machine learning models are becoming increasingly prevalent, but are really hard to understand. Because they are so complex, it is easy for hidden bias to arise and difficult to ensure models are fair and just: there's a lot of math and not a lot of intuition. The goal of this project is to illustrate how investigations of models work.
